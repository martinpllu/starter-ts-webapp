Boilerplate for getting quickly started with a new TypeScript web app.

Uses Webpack to bundle the application code and node module dependencies into dist/bundle.js.

## Quick start

```
npm install         # install dependencies
npm run compiler    # start the tsc and webpack compiler running
npm run server      # start lite-server and launch your web app
```

Then get hacking.
